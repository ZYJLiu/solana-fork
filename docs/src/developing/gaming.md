# Intro into gaming on Solana

The gaming space in the Solana ecosystem is growing. Integrating with Solana can provide benefits for almost any game, allowing players to own and trade their assets via NFTs, build a real economy, or create composable game programs.

Solana for games can be thought of as a big decentralized database that has an insert delay of 1-2 seconds. 
With this in mind, almost all games that are not real-time games like shooters or racing games could theoretically be built directly on the blockchain. In many cases, however, it can be beneficial to keep most of your game logic off the chain and use Solana only for certain aspects of the game.

The fees for transactions are fractions of a cent, and the tooling for game development is continuously improving. You can build your game in Javascript and Canvas, Flutter, or use one of the Solana Game SDKs for the two biggest game engines, Unity and Unreal.

There are multiple ways to integrate Solana into your game:

1. The easiest way is to create an NFT collection and give the holders of your collection certain benefits and traits in the game. (See NFTs in games)
2. Use Sol- or an SPL-token for in-app purchases or micro payments in the game. (See Monetization)
3. Use the player's wallet to authenticate them in the game.
4. Develop the game completely on-chain to take advantage of Solana's security and architecture, which is similar to a slower Firebase's real-time database. (See Hello World example)
