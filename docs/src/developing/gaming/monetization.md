# Monetization

Building a game on Solana opens up a lot of interesting monetization options for games.

- You can sell NFTs to raise raise money. It is basically like crowd sourcing the development of your game. If the game becomes successful the value of the NFTs will likely also go up.
- NFTs on Solana can define a resell fee for NFTs which most market places read and use. This means that on every NFT sell on a secondary market place you will get a cut. This can be a constant income stream if the NFTs are traded a lot.
- You can let players stake NFTs to gain an in game token. These tokens can then also be traded on decentralized marketplaces.
- Tokens can be created and sold to investors (Just be aware of security law in your country)
- With crypto currency it is easily possible to let players compete for rewards or let them bet on certain game outcomes. For example in Games like Poker, Chess or luck based games. You could then take a small fee per game for example.
- Subscription based model like World of Warcraft but players pay in Sol or SPL Tokens
- Let people purchase in game SPL token for crypto or Fiat (Like in for example Albion online)
- Running Tournaments: Entry fee for example is 0.1 Sol and then 95% of all intake will be payed out to the winners and 5% to you running the service.
- In general for a sustainable business model and tokenomics think of player trading time for value and then there will always be “low time-high money” players which take the other side of the trade and invest money to progress faster and save time. With this mindset you can build a sustainable pay to earn game where “low time-high money” players pay for “low money-high time” players and you will be able to take a cut to provide the service.
- Create a brand and sell merch. Could be bought with Sol or SPL Tokens. And maybe players could slowly grind these tokens, so that very engaged players can also get rewarded. 
- You could also include ads into the game. The rewards from the ads could then be used to pay for transactions fees or to give out ingame tokens.
