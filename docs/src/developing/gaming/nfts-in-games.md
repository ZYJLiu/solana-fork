# NFTs In Games

## Nft use cases

NFTs are probably the easiest and most popular way to integrate Solana into your game. 

- You can for example only allow players that own an NFT of an NFT collection to enter the game.
In [js](https://docs.solana.com/de/developing/clients/javascript-api) using the [Metaplex sdk](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/js#readme) this would look like this: 

```js
    JSON.parse(
      // For example '.config/solana/devnet.json'
      fs.readFileSync("yourKeyPair.json").toString())
    );
    let keyPair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(decodedKey);

    const metaplex = Metaplex.make(connection).use(keypairIdentity(keyPair));

    const nfts = await metaplex
      .nfts()
      .findAllByOwner({ owner: wallet.publicKey })
     
    let collectionNfts = []
    for (let i = 0; i < nfts.length; i++) {
      if (nfts[i].collection?.address.toString() == collectionAddress.toString()) {
        collectionNfts.push(nfts[i])
      }
    }
```

- Players could also gain certain bonuses by owning certain NFTs. For example a coin doubler NFT, which grants the player 2x coin as long as he has the NFT in his wallet.
- NFTs also have Metadata, which can be used for all kind of traits for game objects. For example an NFT could represent a game character and his traits Strength/Intelligence/Agility etc could directly influence how strong the character is in the game.
This is how you can load nft meta data and their attributes in js: 

```js
    JSON.parse(
      // For example '.config/solana/devnet.json'
      fs.readFileSync("yourKeyPair.json").toString())
    );
    let keyPair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(decodedKey);

    const metaplex = Metaplex.make(connection).use(keypairIdentity(keyPair));
    const nfts = await metaplex.nfts()
    .findAllByOwner({owner: keyPair.publicKey});
   
    nfts.forEach(async nft => {
      const meta = await metaplex.nfts()
        .load({metadata: nft});
        console.log("Name: " + meta.json.name);
        meta.json.attributes.forEach(async attribute => {
          console.log(JSON.stringify(attribute));
        });
    })
````

- NFTs can also directly be objects in a game. For example you could create a plant plot NFT and then use [Metaplex Fusion Trifle program](https://docs.metaplex.com/guides/fusion) to combine it with a water NFT and a seed NFT to create a Tomato NFT.
- NFTs can also own other NFTs, so with [Raindrops Boots program](https://docs.raindrops.xyz/services/boots) you could for example have an adventure character which owns a sword and a helmet. When the Character NFT would be sold on a market place the other NFTs it owns would be sold as well.

The possibilities are pretty much endless.

## How to create an NFT collection

NFTs on Solana mostly follow the Metaplex standard. The most common way to create an NFT collection is to create a candy machine which lets the user mint predefined pairs of meta data and images.
